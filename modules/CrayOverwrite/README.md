# Subdirectories

  * ``core/cpe-generic``: The overwrite modules for our purpose.

  * ``core/cpe``: Contains ``restore-defaults.lua``, an alternative way to restore
    the defaults instead of running the script suggested by the Cray module.

  * ``data-cpe``: Files that are only needed on those systems that lack the cpe
    modules, currently just there to be able to test on the Grenoble system.
