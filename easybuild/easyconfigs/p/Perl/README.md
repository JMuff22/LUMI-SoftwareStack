## EasyBuild

  * [Perl support in the CSCS repository](https://github.com/eth-cscs/production/tree/master/easybuild/easyconfigs/p/Perl)


### Version 5.34 for CPE 21.06

  * The EasyConfig is a straight port of the EasyBuilders one for 2021b, except that
    we made OpenSSL a OS dependency since we want to use the OS version of security
    libraries as much as possible to ensure that they get patched.
