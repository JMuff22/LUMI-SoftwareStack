### Version 1.17 from CPE 21.06 on

  * The EasyConfig is derived from the EasyBuilders and University of Antwerpen ones
    with additional testing.

  * **NOTE: The build process also uses Perl which is currently taken from the system
    to avoid having to build an incomplete Perl that early in the build cycle.**
