## EasyBuild

  * There is no support in the EasyBuilders repository

  * There is no support in the CSCS repository

### Version 0.98.1

  * The EasyConfig is an adaptation of an internal EasyConfig file from the
    University of Antwerpen. It is a straightforward configure - make - make
    install process.
    
## TODO

  * Currently the flag `-match=native` is added. It might be possible to prevent
    this with `--enable-native=no`. Try this out and implement in the next version
    to ensure proper cross-compiling.
