## EasyBuild


  * [libxml2 support in the EasyBuilders repository]()

  * [libxml2 support in the CSCS repository]()


### Version 2.9.12 from CPE 21.06 on

  * The EasyConfig is derived from the University of Antwerpen one as that one does
    a more complete build of libxml2 with additional dependencies that the configure
    process searches for and may otherwise pick from the system. Additional sanity checks
    were also added.
