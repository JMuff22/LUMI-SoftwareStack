ModuleExtensions/.*:
Unfortunately due to problems with Cray LMOD this module does not yet have the desired effect.
We are looking for a solution but don't expect anything soon.

aocc/3.0.0:
The AMD AOCC compiler version 3.0.0 does not work on LUMI. The workaround is to use a different
version of the compiler.

cpe/21.05:
The Cray Programming Environment 21.05 is deprecated on LUMI and can no longer be supported. Please
switch to the 21.12 programming environment (the current default). 21.05 will be removed in a 
future maintenance interval.

aocc/2.2.*:
The AMD aocc 2.2* compilers are part of the Cray Programming Environment 21.05 and can no longer
be supported. Please switch to the aocc/3.1.0 compilers that come with the 21.12 programming
environment. All 21.05 related files will be removed at a future maintenance interval.

cce/11.0.4:
The Cray cce 11 compilers are part of the Cray Programming Environment 21.05 and can no longer
be supported. Please switch to the cce/13.0.0 compilers that come with the 21.12 programming
environment. All 21.05 related files will be removed at a future maintenance interval.

cray-mpich/8.1.5:
The cray-mpich/8.1.5 module is part of the Cray Programming Environment 21.05 and can no longer
be supported. Please switch to the cray-mpich/8.1.12 module that comes with the 21.12 programming
environment. All 21.05 related files will be removed at a future maintenance interval.

LUMI/21.08:
The LUMI/21.08 software stack is deprecated and will be removed in a future maintenance period.
Please switch to the more recent 21.12, or 22.06 when that one becomes available.
