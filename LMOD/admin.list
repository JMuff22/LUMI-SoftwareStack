ModuleExtensions/.*:
Unfortunately due to problems with Cray LMOD this module does not yet have the desired effect.
We are looking for a solution but don't expect anything soon.

aocc/3.0.0:
The AMD AOCC compiler version 3.0.0 does not work on LUMI. The workaround is to use a different

This software stack is still under construction and will not yet work on the whole system.
