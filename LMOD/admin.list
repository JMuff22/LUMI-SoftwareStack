ModuleExtensions/.*:
Unfortunately due to problems with Cray LMOD this module does not yet have the desired effect.
We are looking for a solution but don't expect anything soon.

aocc/3.0.0:
The AMD AOCC compiler version 3.0.0 does not work on LUMI. The workaround is to use a different
version of the compiler.

cpe/21.05:
The Cray Programming Environment 21.05 is deprecated on LUMI and can no longer be supported. Please
switch to the 21.12 programming environment (the current default). 21.05 will be removed in a 
future maintenance interval.

aocc/2.2.*:
The AMD aocc 2.2* compilers are part of the Cray Programming Environment 21.05 and can no longer
be supported. Please switch to the aocc/3.1.0 compilers that come with the 21.12 programming
environment. All 21.05 related files will be removed at a future maintenance interval.

cce/11.0.4:
The Cray cce 11 compilers are part of the Cray Programming Environment 21.05 and can no longer
be supported. Please switch to the cce/13.0.0 compilers that come with the 21.12 programming
environment. All 21.05 related files will be removed at a future maintenance interval.

cray-mpich/8.1.5:
The cray-mpich/8.1.5 module is part of the Cray Programming Environment 21.05 and can no longer
be supported. Please switch to the cray-mpich/8.1.12 module that comes with the 21.12 programming
environment. All 21.05 related files will be removed at a future maintenance interval.

LUMI/21.08:
The LUMI/21.08 software stack is currently hidden and broken due to missing components on the 
system after the upgrade in early July. It will work for some users but not all, so try at your
own risk. It is not clear if it will be possible to offer this stack again. Users should move
to 21.12 in the short term and to 22.06 in the longer term (or if it already satisfies your needs).
Do not to attempt to recompile software with 21.08, as you will get unexpected results.
