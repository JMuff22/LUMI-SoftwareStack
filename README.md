# LUMI Software Stack main repository

This repository contains the LMOD and EasyBuild setup for the
[LUMI supercomputer](https://www.lumi-supercomputer.eu/), a HPE Cray EX
system with a CPU and GPU section based on AMD Epyc processors and a
GPU from the AMD Instinct family.

The contents of this repository may be pretty useless to you if you don't
have access to a system with the Cray Programming Environment on it. However,
should you have access, you can experiment with the content without needing
administrative rights.

See [the "Proceedures" in the documentation subdirectory, section "Making a master
installation of the software stack](docs/procedures.md#making-a-master-installation-of-the-software-stack)
on how to set up a test setup.
