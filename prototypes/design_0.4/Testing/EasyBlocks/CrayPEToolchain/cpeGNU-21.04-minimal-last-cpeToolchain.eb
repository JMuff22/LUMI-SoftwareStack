description = """
This module is the EasyBuild toolchain that uses the Cray compiler wrapper with
the gcc compiler activated. The components loaded are those of the Cray Programming
Environment (CPE) version %(version)s.

Expected outcome: a LUA module that
  * Declares itself a member of the cpeToolchain family
  * Loads PrgEnv-gnu
  * Loads cpe/21.04

This module will only work correctly once the ordering problem in the cpe module that
exists in version 21.04 is solved.
