]

description = """
This module is the EasyBuild toolchain that uses the Cray compiler wrapper with
the gcc compiler activated. The components loaded are those of the Cray Programming
Environment (CPE) version %(version)s.

The module has the same effect as loading PrgEnv-gnu and cpe/21.04 should have, but
does not use either of those modules. The use of PrgEnv-gnu is avoided since the
modules that it loads may change over time, reducing reproducibilty, while loading
cpe/21.04 is avoided as this module is buggy and conflicts with the way the LUMI
software stack currently works. Instead, the module declares itself a member of
the PrgEnv family and sets an PE_ENV which would otherwise be set by PrgEnv-gnu,
ensuring that the Cray PE will work as if those modules are loaded.

The effect of loading this module is:
  * All PrgEnv or other cpe* modules will be unloaded as they are part of
    the PrgEnv family (at least if they are generated in a consistent way).
  * PE_ENV is set to GNU
  * The three targeting modules are loaded:
      * craype-x86-rome
      * craype-accel-host
      * craype-network-ofi
  * The other modules are loaded in the order and version specified:
      * gcc/9.3.0
      * craype/2.7.6
      * cray-mpich/8.1.4
      * cray-libsci/21.04.1.1
      * cray-dsmml/0.1.4
      * perftools-base/21.02.0
      * xpmem
