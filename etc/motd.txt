   | During the late June - early July downtime LUMI-G was          |
 * | integrated and is now under testing. The LUMI-C interconnect   |
   | was upgraded to 200 Gbit/s. The system software received many  |
*  | updates and the 22.06 programming environment was installed.   |
   |                                                                |
 * | LUMI/21.12 is now the recommended LUMI software stack but      |
   | users are encouraged to switch to LUMI/22.06 as soon as it     |
   | satisfies their needs. LUMI/21.08 is currently hidden as it    |
*  | does not fully function but may reappear. You can still load   |
   | the modules but at your own risk (and you will get             |
   | replacements instead).                                         |           
 * |                                                                |
   | LUMI-C will have reduced capacity during much of July due to   |
 * | maintenance of the cooling.                                    |
   |                                                                |
*  | Further system software updates are planned for late July and  |
*  | September to improve performance on LUMI-G.                    |
   |                                                                |
  *| The flash file system on /flash/project_<...> is unavailable   |
   | until the next upgrade scheduled for late July or later given  |
   | the problems that still exist after the last upgrade.          |
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
** |   and other tools.                                             |
