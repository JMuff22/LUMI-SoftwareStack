   | Between February 7 and February 23 LUMI received an upgrade of |
 * | the system software which included a OS upgrade from SLES 15   |
   | SP1 to SP2. If software stopped working, please contact LUMI   |
*  | user support via the link given above.                         |
   |                                                                |
*  | The core of the LUMI 21/12 software stack is installed.        |
   | EasyBuild recipes for packages for user installations still    |
 * | need to be adapted, so installations of additional packages    |
   | still require some EasyBuild expertise to adapt toolchain and  |
   | dependency versions.                                           |
