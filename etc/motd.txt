 * | In the first half of August several silent updates were done   |
   | on the system to further enable LUMI-G which is still under    |
   | testing.                                                       |
*  |                                                                |
   | On August 18 the default programming environment was changed   |
  *| to the 22.08 enviornment which should solve some problems with |
   | 22.06. In the coming days the software stack will be ported to |
   | this enviornment and will then be the recommended version of   |
 * | the LUMI stack. LUMI/21.12 is currently the most complete      |
   | software stack but users are recommended to switch to 22.08    |
   | as soon as it satisfies their needs.                           |
*  |                                                                |
 * | LUMI/21.08 is hidden as it does not fully function and will    |
   | not reappear. You can still load the modules but at your own   |
   | risk (and will get replacements instead). It is not possible   |
*  | to reliably do new installations in 21.08.                     |
   |                                                                |
  *| The flash file system on /flash/project_<...> is unavailable   |
   | until the next upgrade currently scheduled for September as    |
   | the software is not yet fully ready.                           |
*  .Notes-----------------------------------------------------------.
   | Make sure one of the following modules is loaded to have the   |
 * | full LUMI experience:                                          |
   | - CrayEnv: The Cray software stack enriched with some          |
   |   additional tools not installed by default in the OS          |
*  | - LUMI: The extensible LUMI software stack that you can use    |
   |   as a basis for additional software installs with EasyBuild   |
** |   and other tools.                                             |
