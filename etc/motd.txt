   | Between February 7 and February 23 LUMI received an upgrade of |
 * | the system software which included a OS upgrade from SLES 15   |
   | SP1 to SP2. If software stopped working, please contact LUMI   |
*  | user support via the link given above.                         |
   |                                                                |
   | The update also includes a new version of the Cray Programming |
 * | Environment. The previous versions are still available. In     |
   | early March we will make a LUMI/21.12 software stack available |
 * | using the Cray PE version 21.12. However, the build recipes    |
   | provided in the contributed repository will also need updating |
*  | which will happen after the installation of the core 21.12     |
   | software stack.                                                |
